# Sound Effects

This folder should contain the following audio files (MP3 format recommended):

1. **click.mp3** - Button click sound (short, punchy)
2. **typewriter.mp3** - Typewriter effect sound (light, subtle)

## How to Add Sounds

1. Download or create audio files in MP3 format
2. Place them in this directory with the exact names above
3. Sounds will automatically play when buttons are clicked and text is rendered

## Audio Settings

- Volume is set to 30% (0.3) in soundEffects.js
- Can be adjusted by modifying the `audio.volume = 0.3` line

## Browser Support

Audio playback requires user interaction in modern browsers. Sounds will play on button clicks and text rendering events.
